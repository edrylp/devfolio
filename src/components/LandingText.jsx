            I'm a web developer who learns best by building. I like turning
            ideas into working applications, figuring out how things work, and
            discovering something new with every project. I've worked with Vue,
            React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I'm always looking for
            ways to improve how I write and build web applications.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My journey into web development started as a career change, and a
            lot of my learning has come from self-study, hands-on projects, and
            simply spending time solving problems I don't understand yet. I'm
            still growing as a developer, but I genuinely enjoy the process, and
            I'm excited to keep learning, building, and becoming better at what
            I do.
